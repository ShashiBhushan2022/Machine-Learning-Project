# Machine-Learning-Project
Developed a machine learning system to predict electrical load demand using historical data. Preprocessed data, and implemented models like Bagging and Boosting Trees, Decision Trees, SVM, and Neural Networks. Optimized accuracy with metrics like MAE and MAPE, enabling efficient power management.
